 //Okayyy, Let's finish the functioning of the application here in the home.dart file.

 /* The important question you get when you design the application!!

                        whether to make a Stateful class or Stateless class ?
                                     Umm, What you say ??

                                  Kudos, If you know what to use,You can go ahead or If you can't say , no worries! Just have wild guess and
                                  see below .
                                  We are here to help you out..

                                  You should be using a Stateful widget here for the functioning as the screen contains button
                                   which onPressed should show you the value of the BMI index
